Z Game - Dev Notes/README

==== Notes: ====

- For the lib folder, there should be two .h files, a .lib file, and a .dll. The .dll needs to be in the project folder when you run the exe, everything else just needs to be included properly by the IDE.

==== To Do: ====

- Figure out a plan for who does what, etc.

- For Version 0.02: Setup some Zombies and basic "pathfinding"!
